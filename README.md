# Cybersecurity Awareness Demonstration

## Web-Based Social Engineering Simulation

---

## Overview

This project is a **web-based cybersecurity awareness demonstration** designed to educate users on how modern cyber threats leverage **social engineering** and **permission misuse**, rather than traditional malware-based attacks.

The application simulates a familiar **video-conferencing interface** to demonstrate how attackers can manipulate **trust, branding, and user behavior** to gain access to sensitive device permissions and personal data.

> **Important:**
> This project is strictly intended for **educational, research, and awareness purposes**.
> All demonstrations must be conducted with **explicit participant consent**.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

* Demonstrate the risks associated with blindly granting browser permissions
* Educate users on modern phishing and impersonation techniques
* Highlight browser-based attack vectors that do not require malware installation
* Promote safer digital behavior and informed decision-making

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Social Engineering

* Impersonation of trusted platforms
* UI-based deception techniques
* Trust exploitation without exploiting technical vulnerabilities

### Permission Exploitation

* Camera and microphone access requests
* Geolocation tracking
* Device and browser fingerprinting

### Client-Side Data Exposure

* Screen capture techniques
* Camera frame capture
* Background monitoring behavior

### Data Exfiltration Simulation

* Demonstrates how captured data can be transmitted to external endpoints
* Uses common APIs to reflect real-world attack methodologies

## Features

* Realistic meeting-style user interface
* Single-prompt permission request flow
* Device and environment information collection
* Periodic screenshot and camera frame capture
* Location tracking (if permitted)
* Demonstration-only data transmission logic

## Intended Audience

* Cybersecurity students
* Ethical hacking learners
* Academic institutions
* Security awareness programs
* Technical exhibitions and demonstrations

## Ethical Use Policy

This project **must only** be used under the following conditions:

* Explicit informed consent from all participants
* Use limited to controlled environments (labs, classrooms, demonstrations)
* No real credentials or private data collected
* No public deployment without safeguards
* Data handling limited strictly to demonstration purposes

### Prohibited Usage

* Unauthorized monitoring or surveillance
* Public phishing campaigns
* Real-world exploitation
* Collection of sensitive personal data without consent

---

## Security & Privacy Considerations

Participants must be informed **after the demonstration** about:

* Permissions granted
* Types of data that could be accessed
* Potential real-world risks

Additional considerations:

* Tokens, endpoints, and integrations should be replaced with mock or test services
* All captured data should be temporary and non-persistent

## Learning Outcomes

Participants will gain an understanding of:

* How social engineering attacks operate
* Why browser permissions pose significant security risks
* How attackers exploit user trust
* How legitimate-looking interfaces can be weaponized
* Best practices for personal and organizational digital security

---

## Best Practices Highlighted

* Verify website authenticity before interacting
* Review permission prompts carefully
* Avoid granting unnecessary permissions
* Regularly audit browser permission settings
* Educate peers about social engineering threats

## Conclusion

This demonstration reinforces a critical cybersecurity principle:

> **Human behavior is often the weakest link in security.**
